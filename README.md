## 📜 Description

The Programmer's Prayer is an interactive, multi-language web experience that provides spiritual guidance for those who've seen the void that lurks between merge conflicts. This repository contains a carefully crafted HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation optimized for both digital contemplation and physical printing.

```
Deliver us from segfaults,
Those cracks in the binary soul,
Where logic goes to die.
```

## ✨ Features

- 🌐 Multi-language support (English/French)
- 🖨️ Print-optimized styling for cubicle decoration
- 📱 Responsive design that works on all devices
- 🔮 Matrix-inspired rain animation for enhanced contemplation
- ⌨️ Terminal-inspired UI with geeky typography

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dev-monastery/programmers-prayer.git
cd programmers-prayer
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve with your favorite dev server:

```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server

# Using Node.js
npx serve
```

3. Pray for your code to compile on the first try

## 🙏 Usage

For best results, recite daily before:
- Merging to production on Friday afternoon
- Attempting to understand legacy code
- Explaining to the PM why the feature will take longer than estimated
- Debugging a race condition
- Writing documentation

## 🔮 The Oracle

When your prayers need additional assistance, consult the oracle by opening the browser console:

```javascript
const oracle = {
  askQuestion: function(question) {
    const responses = [
      "Have you tried turning it off and on again?",
      "It's not a bug, it's an undocumented feature.",
      "It works on my machine.",
      "The answer lies in the stack trace.",
      "Abandon hope all ye who debug here."
    ];
    return responses[Math.floor(Math.random() * responses.length)];
  }
};

// Usage
console.log(oracle.askQuestion("Will my code ever work?"));
```
